Earthquake Odyssey: Navigating the Historical Landscape of Seismic Events (Significant Earthquake Dataset 1900-2023)
I have a profound interest in the field of disaster management, which is why I chose to study Disaster Management during my first and second semesters as a part of the Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS) curriculum. Additionally, I am an avid data science enthusiast, and this passion led me to embark on an exploratory data analysis project focused on global earthquake data. In the pursuit of this project, I harnessed substantial datasets and employed various analytical techniques. The core dataset for my analysis was sourced from the USGS Earthquake Database(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahaidulislam/significant-earthquake-dataset-1900-2023/data. By applying the skills Iâ€™ve acquired, particularly in the areas of CSV file manipulation, and utilizing libraries such as Basemap, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and fundamental statistical methods, I aspired to uncover valuable insights about earthquakes. Each section of my analysis is structured around a specific question, highlighted in bold, that aims to shed light on various aspects of earthquake occurrences and characteristics.
